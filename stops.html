<p>We plan to see the General Sherman Tree and explore the Giant Forest area to walk among the massive sequoias up close. We'll hike the Moro Rock trail for panoramic views over the Sierra Nevada and drive the scenic route down into Kings Canyon to experience the dramatic canyon landscape. Along the way, we'll stop at viewpoints, take shorter forest hikes, and spend time exploring shaded trails at higher elevation. We'll be camping overnight in the mountains, taking advantage of the cooler temperatures and quiet forest atmosphere before heading to our next stop.</p>

<p>We plan to spend most of our time in Yosemite Valley, stopping at Tunnel View and Glacier Point for wide views of El Capitan, Half Dome, and the surrounding granite cliffs. We'll hike to Yosemite Falls and possibly take part of the Mist Trail toward Vernal or Nevada Fall, depending on conditions. In addition to the main viewpoints, we want to walk through the valley floor, explore meadows and river areas, and take time to see the iconic rock formations up close. We'll be camping nearby so we can catch sunset in the park and get an early start the next morning before crowds build.</p>


<h2 id="redwoods" class="section-title">Redwood National and State Parks</h2>

<p>In the Redwoods, we want to experience the awe of walking among the tallest trees on Earth. We'll explore trails like Lady Bird Johnson Grove and Tall Trees Grove to see the massive redwoods up close. We also plan to drive through the scenic Newton B. Drury Parkway and visit Fern Canyon for its moss-covered walls. Camping in the redwoods will allow us to enjoy the peaceful forest atmosphere and see local wildlife.</p>

 <h2 id="sf" class="section-title">San Francisco</h2>

    <p>San Francisco will be our final stop, where we'll slow down and explore the city itself. We plan to start by visiting Chinatown for food and wandering the streets, then spend time in nearby parks like Golden Gate Park and along the waterfront. We also want to explore the coast north of the city, heading west of Marin to see the shoreline and ocean views. The rest of the time will be spent walking different neighborhoods, checking out the city vibe, and ending the trip with a mix of coastal scenery and classic San Francisco spots.</p>
